## Platform Engineering
Platform Engineering is all about delivering platforms to users as products. These users usually are developers themselves, yet they need toolings for their day-to-day work to be done. As an example source hosting platforms, or task managmeent or documentation. As a Platform Engineer, you will be tasked with delivering and supporting these platform's reliabilty, and having a product-centric mindset, as this helps delivering best experiences for the end users of these platforms.

Platform engineers take the responsibility of the infrastructure management out of the developer hands and provide ready to use products. They build, maintain and operate internal developer platforms (IDPs), which are sets of tools and infrastructure that standardize software development, deployment and operation processes.

Platform engineers work closely with software developers to make sure the platform is user-friendly while educating them on platform usage best practices. They stay informed of the latest industry trends and technologies to make sure that business innovation can continue at high velocity, keeping their organization ahead of the curve.

Gartner in one of its press release articles [predicts that Platform Engineering will reach mainstream adoption in two to five years](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years).

### Why Platform Engineering?
A lot of salary surveys show a big difference in salary between a Platform Engineer and Devops Engineer. For example [this survey](https://platformengineering.org/reports/state-of-platform-engineering-vol-3) done by [platformengineering.org](https://platofrmengineering.org) shows almost 56k increase in salary for Platform Engineers over Devops in Europe.

# What is needed to be a Platform Engineer?
As with any other job title, it takes a certian skills to be an efficient and productive Platform Engineer, not only that but also a specific mindset. We will go throgh these two points in detail.

### Platform Engineer Skillset

A successful Platform Engineer requires a diverse set of skills that combine technical expertise, strategic thinking, and a user-focused mindset. Below is a refined and comprehensive list of key skills:

### Proficiency in Programming and Scripting Languages
Strong knowledge of languages like Python, Go, or Bash for building automation tools, scripts, and APIs that enhance platform capabilities.
  
### Deep Understanding of Cloud Computing Concepts
Expertise in cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, including services for compute, storage, networking, and serverless architectures.
  
### Networking Fundamentals and Advanced Concepts
Solid understanding of networking concepts, such as load balancing, DNS, firewalls, and service mesh technologies, to ensure reliable and secure platform operations.
  
### Expertise in CI/CD Pipelines, Concepts, and Practices
Advanced knowledge of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or ArgoCD. A strong mindset for automating and streamlining software delivery processes.
  
### Proficiency in Containerization and Orchestration Technologies
Hands-on experience with container tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, including knowledge of managing multi-cluster environments.
  
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Expertise
Strong skills in IaC tools such as Terraform, Pulumi, or AWS CloudFormation to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure in a scalable and reproducible manner.
  
### Mastery of Monitoring and Observability Concepts
Proficiency with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or Datadog for ensuring visibility into platform health, performance, and reliability. Familiarity with distributed tracing, log aggregation, and anomaly detection techniques.

### Collaboration and Communication Skills
Ability to work closely with developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders to align platform capabilities with business needs and ensure smooth adoption.
  
### Security Awareness
Knowledge of securing platforms and infrastructure, including identity and access management (IAM), encryption, and vulnerability assessment tools.

These skills collectively enable Platform Engineers to design, build, and manage scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platforms that empower development teams and drive business innovation.

### Platform Engineer Mindset
- Adopting a product management mindset for platform engineering.
- Building developer personas and understanding their workflows.
- Creating feedback loops with end-users (developers and stakeholders).
- Metrics-driven development for platform features.
